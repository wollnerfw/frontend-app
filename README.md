# React + Vite Template Example Web Application
This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. 
This will install and run a local server for the frontend application - but requires the corresponding backend application to run in order to fully function.

## To install and run:
For Unix based systems (be sure you have node 18+ installed):
```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```
